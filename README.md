This crate provides bindings over Parrot's `libpdraw` (and most of the other Parrot libraries, such as `libpdraw-vsink`, etc.)

The main use case is to support metadata extraction from [Anafi videos](https://developer.parrot.com/docs/pdraw/video-metadata.html).
Other use cases may not have been tested.
